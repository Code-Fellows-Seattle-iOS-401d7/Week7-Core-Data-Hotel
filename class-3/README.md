#Week 8 - Class 3
##Homework
* Write 10 Tests for the AutoLayout class.
* Implement NSFetchedResultsController in AvailabilityViewController.
* Implement LookupViewController.
	* Implement a UISearchBar to fetch reservations based on the predicateFormat:`@"guest.name == %@", searchText`.(searchText represents the text entered in the UISearchBar)
	* Implement a TableView to display the array of reservations returned from the fetch of reservations.
* **Bonus:**
	* Create a ReservationService, similar to our AutoLayout class, that should abstract away your business logic (booking reservations, checking availability, etc)
